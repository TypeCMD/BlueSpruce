A programming language run in python.
# Usage (Requires python installed)
## macOS
Clone the repository. Run `nano ~/.zshrc` (or use your preferred method of text editing). Add `alias bluespruce='python3 path/to/repository/BlueSpruce/bluespruce.py'`. Save and exit. Run `bluespruce` and it will ask for the filename. Put in a file with a .bluespruce extension and you can run it.

## Windows
I'm not sure

## Linux
Pretty much the same as macOS.
